## 🎯 What is ASI-Core?

ASI-Core is a **hybrid AI reflection system** that combines:

- 🧠 **Personal Memory** - Store and organize your thoughts, ideas, insights
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Analysis** - Automatic state detection, pattern recognition  
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Storage** - Decentralized, permanent memory preservation
- 📱 **Progressive Web App** - Works offline, installs like native app
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** - Your data stays yours, processed locally

### 🚀 What can you build?

- **🎓 Learning Assistants** - Remember everything you study
- **💡 Idea Managers** - Capture and connect creative insights  
- **🧘 Wellness Apps** - Track emotional states and patterns
- **📊 Research Tools** - Organize knowledge and discoveries
- **🤖 Personal AI** - Build assistants that know your history

## 🎬 Live Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from asi_core import ASICore

# Create your digital brain
brain = ASICore.create()

# Store a memory with automatic AI analysis  
memory = brain.add_reflection(
    "Had a breakthrough in my React project today!",
    tags=["coding", "success"]
)

# AI automatically detected positive state: 85/255
print(f"State detected: {memory.state}")  # Positive: 85

# Find related memories
similar = brain.search("React breakthrough")
# Returns memories with semantic similarity
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# Blockchain preservation (optional)
brain.preserve_to_blockchain(memory.id)

# Pattern recognition
patterns = brain.analyze_patterns(timeframe="last_month")
# Discovers learning streaks, emotional patterns, etc.

# State-based filtering  
positive_memories = brain.filter_by_state(range(70, 100))
```
