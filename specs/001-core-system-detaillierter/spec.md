## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **student/researcher/developer** learning about the ASI Core System, I want to access a comprehensive, structured study guide that covers all system components, principles, and implementation concepts, so that I can understand the complete architecture and philosophy behind the decentralized digital consciousness platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am new to the ASI Core System, **When** I access the study guide, **Then** I should see a clear progression from basic principles to advanced concepts
2. **Given** I am studying a specific component (e.g., Token Economy), **When** I complete the section, **Then** I should be able to explain the $MEM token specifications and mechanisms
3. **Given** I have completed studying all sections, **When** I take the quiz, **Then** I should be able to answer questions about system architecture, privacy strategies, and storage solutions
4. **Given** I need to reference specific terms, **When** I access the glossary, **Then** I should find comprehensive definitions for all technical concepts
5. **Given** I want to test my deeper understanding, **When** I review essay questions, **Then** I should be able to analyze complex system interactions and trade-offs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when learners skip foundational sections and jump to advanced topics?
- How does the guide support different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)?
- How can instructors adapt the content for different technical backgrounds?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
